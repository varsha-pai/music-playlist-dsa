The "Music Playlist Management System" is a project aimed at developing a software solution for organizing and managing music playlists using doubly linked lists in the C programming language. This system provides functionalities for creating, editing, and interacting with playlists containing various songs.
The project facilitates efficient management of music playlists by leveraging the flexibility and versatility of doubly linked lists. By allowing dynamic addition, removal, and traversal of songs in the playlist, users can organize their music collection seamlessly. Furthermore, the project serves as a foundation for future enhancements, including the incorporation of additional features such as sorting, searching, and playback functionalities.
